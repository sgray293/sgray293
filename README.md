- 👋 Hi, I’m Shickare. Also known as Shickare the Scripter
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and all that comes with it.  I absolutely love to learn and apply what i've learned.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of projects to build my portfolio and above all become a more profeccient and efficient coder/programmer.
